    <p>It's impossible to imagine our modern lives without science. Just think... we'd have no electricity, no cell phones or internet, no medicine, primitive transport infrastructure, unsafe buildings and bridges... it would be like living in the Middle Ages.</p>
    <p>In our department we are passionate about encouraging and inspiring the next generaton of scientists, doctors, nurses and engineers.  We strive to provide a hands-on experience because we believe science is a process, not just a body of knowledge to memorize. Instead we want to engage students creativity and innovation by offering open-ended challenges and more complex problems. </p>

    <p>Social studies, as defined in the BC curriculum, is a multidisciplinary subject that draws from the social sciences and humanities to study human interaction and natural and social environments. The overarching goal of social studies is to develop thoughtful, responsible, active citizens who are able to acquire the requisite information to consider multiple perspectives and to make reasoned judgments.</p>
    <p> The Social Studies curriculum provides students with opportunities as future citizens to critically reflect upon events and issues in order to examine the present, make connections with the past, and consider the future.</p>
